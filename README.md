    The Next.js weather widget is a web application designed to 
    provide users with up-to-date weather information for multiple
    locations. Built using Next.js, a popular React framework, 
    this widget offers a responsive and interactive user 
    experience.
    At its core, the widget consists of several key components. 
    The main section of the widget features tabs that allow users 
    to switch between viewing weather information based on city 
    names or geographical coordinates. Users can input their 
    desired location in the corresponding input field and click 
    the "Search" button to retrieve weather data. Additionally, 
    if geolocation is available, the widget automatically fetches 
    weather data based on the user's current coordinates.
    Once weather data is retrieved, it is displayed in a visually appealing format. 
    Each location's weather information is presented within a 
    card-like container, featuring an icon representing the 
    current weather condition, temperature in Celsius, and a 
    brief description of the weather. Alongside this, the 
    location's name and the current date are displayed, providing 
    context to the weather data. Users can also click on the "More" 
    button to access additional weather details for the selected 
    location.  Moreover, the widget offers a convenient feature through a 
    drawer component. Users can open the drawer to reveal a 
    carousel displaying weather information for multiple 
    pre-defined locations simultaneously. Each carousel item 
    presents weather data in a similar format to the main widget, 
    allowing users to quickly glance through the weather conditions
     of various cities without leaving the current page. With its 
     intuitive design and comprehensive functionality, the Next.js 
     weather widget provides users with a seamless way to stay 
     informed about weather conditions worldwide.
